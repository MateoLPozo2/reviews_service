Project Prompt: Research Review Publishing Platform

I‚Äôm building a structured, extensible, and professionally compliant web platform that allows users to create, publish, and navigate in-depth reviews of academic papers. The system is designed to scale and eventually meet regulatory, copyright, and professional standards.

The platform targets:
	‚Ä¢	Investors seeking reliable summaries of technical innovations
	‚Ä¢	LinkedIn readers and recruiters interested in research-backed insight
	‚Ä¢	The general public looking for accessible, trustworthy knowledge distilled from complex academic sources

‚∏ª

üí° Core System Features
	‚Ä¢	A clean, searchable homepage that lists reviews with filters for domain, year, tags, and reading time
	‚Ä¢	Review pages rendered from Markdown, viewable via SEO-friendly URLs (/mlp/reviews/[nid]/[slug])
	‚Ä¢	Fuzzy full-text search using Fuse.js with live highlighting of results
	‚Ä¢	Tag filtering, persistent query URLs, and categorized metadata
	‚Ä¢	Static routes for legal and branding content (About, Imprint, Terms)
	‚Ä¢	Clean-code architecture: built with SRP (Single Responsibility Principle), low coupling, modularity, and a routing system prepared for future extensibility

‚∏ª

üóÇ Data Architecture & Future-Proofing
	‚Ä¢	Reviews are stored in structured JSON format, each supporting:
	‚Ä¢	title, reviewSummary, authors, doi, domain, tags, version, lastUpdated, wordCount, estimatedReadingTime
	‚Ä¢	Optional: reviewAuthor, impactMetrics, reuseLicense
	‚Ä¢	Static storage is designed to evolve into dynamic backends (e.g., Supabase, Firestore, or custom REST/GraphQL APIs)
	‚Ä¢	Markdown rendering is decoupled from storage logic, supporting clean transitions to CMS or DB-based models

‚∏ª

üìà Planned Features (in roadmap or prototype)
	‚Ä¢	Review versioning: track update history with changelogs and review audit trails
	‚Ä¢	Submission flow: authenticated users can propose, edit, and publish reviews (moderation-ready)
	‚Ä¢	User comments (optional): pending moderation policy and legal compliance
	‚Ä¢	Author dashboard: role-based creation and editing for review contributors
	‚Ä¢	Print-friendly and distraction-free reading modes
	‚Ä¢	Accessibility compliance (WCAG), including screen-reader support and color-safe UI
	‚Ä¢	Dark/light theme switch with system preference detection
	‚Ä¢	Analytics-ready structure: track view counts, engagement metrics, and review popularity

‚∏ª

‚öñÔ∏è Professional & Legal Compliance
	‚Ä¢	Built to respect academic copyright and fair-use limits
	‚Ä¢	Every review links to its source paper (DOI, original title, publication, and authors)
	‚Ä¢	Licensing metadata (license, reuse, sourceAttribution) is embedded for each review
	‚Ä¢	Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Imprint routes included in structure
	‚Ä¢	Architecture accommodates moderation workflows and role-based permissions
